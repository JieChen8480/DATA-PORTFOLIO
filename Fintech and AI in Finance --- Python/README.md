### This is a industry project worked for European COST Network company

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used in data science. It has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to perform complex data analysis tasks, such as data mining, data visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

In this file, you will find examples of Python code that demonstrate my proficiency in data science using Python. You'll find a diverse set of projects that covers a wide range of data analysis techniques, such as data cleaning, data exploration, data visualization, and statistical modeling. These projects showcase my ability to extract insights from data and present them in a clear and visually appealing way.

I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications and experience further. Thank you for visiting my repository and happy data analyzing with Python!
